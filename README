# Ardat (Archive dat)
Ardat is a file archiver, that strives to create a readable archive format. The design and the format readability here
is taking priority over ~~my sanity~~ straightforwardness.

## Readable Format
Take a look at these two screenshots:

The ardat file format definitely takes the lead here.
If you think this gets useless the moment you have to archive binaries, think again:

Ardat supports the decorators to encode all the unreadable bytes into readable hexadecimal characters. And who cares
about the fact that it's now double the size. Readability over sanity as I said.
